- How are workers for each tab hired? Part of which UI?

- Does each tab have own workers? Should be very valuable resource based on initial balance thoughts
    * No. Shared resource across tabs.

- Is it necessary with both Sales and Logistics tab?
    * each tab needs distinct justification
        - production = increase banana yield
        - sales = increase income
        - technology = enhances existing tabs & unlocks new features
        - logistics = could be prestige tab
        - administration = worker management and education / payroll / HR - recruiting + training 

- Should tabs have subtabs?
    * Not needed yet. Jobs UI can have subpages for job categories.
        - Plantation - laboratory
        - Sales - transport - processing

- If jobs in the same tab are just basic multipliers how will optimization be complex?
