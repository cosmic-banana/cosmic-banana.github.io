all tabs have:
	jobs - Workers are tied to each tab, part of the jobs UI
	
jobs can have very varied outputs and some jobs can have resource drains, like R&D costs money/time
	
all jobs' output codepend on each other, making all production features relevant from start to finish
meaning jobs will need to be optimally distributed or switched between all the time.

Sales of bananas is also a job but can be bottlenecked by any part of the supply chain,
and each part of the supply chain is simplified into | faster/more, price:
	harvest -> sell
	harvest -> package -> sell
	harvest -> package -> transport -> sell
	harvest -> package -> transport -> sort -> sell
	harvest -> package -> transport -> sort -> grade -> sell
	harvest -> package -> transport -> sort -> grade -> process -> sell
